# JavaScript Proxy

> :goat: For learning how to use [JavaScript Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy), or just to see what is possible through metaprogramming in modern JavaScript. Tries to collect resources such as presentations, articles, modules and examples using Proxy, Reflect and other intercession type metaprogramming.

> The Proxy object was included in the ES2015 iteration of the standard and is available in all evergreen browsers and Node.js v6. Unfortunately as it is a big language semantic change, it cannot be polyfilled through transpilers such as Babel.

Know of any brilliant resources? [Let us know](https://github.com/mikaelbr/proxy-fun/issues/new) and we'll create a vast collection of awesomeness.

TL;DR? See an overview of examples using JavaScript Proxy in [the summary](./examples-summary.md).

### Modules

- [zer](https://github.com/jbmusso/zer): Zer helps you serialize any JavaScript chains to String representations of any languages by leveraging ES2015 `Proxy` objects
- [negative-array](https://github.com/sindresorhus/negative-array): Negative array index support `array[-1]` using ES2015 Proxy
- [tpyo](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/tpyo): A small script that enables you to make typos in JavaScript property names. Powered by ES6 proxies + Levenshtein string distance.
- [stevia](https://github.com/traviskaufman/stevia): Experimental module providing natural sweetening for javascript objects
- [known](https://github.com/sindresorhus/known): Allow only access to known object properties using ES2015 Proxy
- [iSeries](https://github.com/anywhichway/iSeries): A set of modules that use Proxy to extend and enhance your existing JavaScript classes.
- [proxy-observe](https://github.com/anywhichway/proxy-observe): A Proxy based implementation of Object.observe
- [Experimental Safe JavaScript Navigation
](https://gist.github.com/dakaraphi/6a87168db66fd8f032d2): The purpose of this function is to provide a way to avoid deep nested conditionals when traversing a hierarchy of objects

## Meta-programming in general

> Resources not using JavaScript Proxy, but shows different usages of creative and awesome meta-programming to be used as inspiration.

### Modules

- [jsPipe](https://github.com/dzautner/jsPipe): Implementing pipes in Javascript using pseudo operator overloading.
- [JSDecorators](https://github.com/dzautner/JSDecorators): Python like decorators in Javascript with pseudo operator overloading.
